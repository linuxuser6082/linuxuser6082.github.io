 	Hi I am Linux User 608 i make YouTube Vlogs and tutorials. As it says in my name i use Linux i mostly Use Ubuntu Budgie and Linux Mint But Sometimes regular Ubuntu. I use Linux because of the privacy and security, It is also a very fast Operating System most of them anyway but that is a desktop environment problem the name of it is GNOME, to use it you have to have a decent computer, if you do not have on GNOME will still work but it will be slow. Thanks for reading!
